## CRUD REST API - Books

### Description

This is a CRUD REST API created for a school assignment at Medieinstitutet by Oscar Andersson.

The project is built with express.js with four different endpoints (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), where all data is stored in a JSON-file. The server endpoints are tested with Rest Client in VS Code. A basic browser UI is built with HTML and styled with TailwindCSS.
